Release procedure
====================

Release candidate versions
---

 1. Make sure release notes in `NEWS` are up to date.

 2. Run the tests one more time:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew clean check
    ```

 3. Update the Java version in the [`release-verify-signatures`
    workflow](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-verify-signatures.yml#L42).

    See the `openjdk version` line of output from `java -version`:

    ```
    $ java -version  # (example output below)
    openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.7+7)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.7+7, mixed mode)
    ```

    Given the above output as an example, update the workflow like so:

    ```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        java: ["17.0.7"]
    ```

    Check that this version is available in GitHub Actions. Commit this change,
    if any.

 4. Tag the head commit with an `X.Y.Z-RCN` tag:

    ```
    $ git tag -a -s 1.4.0-RC1 -m "Pre-release 1.4.0-RC1"
    ```

    No tag body needed.

 5. Publish to Sonatype Nexus:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
    ```

 6. Push to GitHub.

    If the pre-release makes significant changes to the project README, such
    that the README does not accurately reflect the latest non-pre-release
    version, push the changes on a separate release branch:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b release-1.4.0
    $ git push origin release-1.4.0 1.4.0-RC1
    ```

    If the README still accurately reflects the latest non-pre-release version,
    you can simply push to main instead:

    ```
    $ git push origin main 1.4.0-RC1
    ```

 7. Make GitHub release.

    - Use the new tag as the release tag.
    - Check the pre-release checkbox.
    - Copy the release notes from `NEWS` into the GitHub release notes; reformat
      from ASCIIdoc to Markdown and remove line wraps. Include only
      changes/additions since the previous release or pre-release.
    - Note the JDK version shown by `java -version` in step 3.
      For example: `openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18`.

 8. Check that the ["Reproducible binary"
    workflow](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/actions/workflows/release-verify-signatures.yml)
    runs and succeeds.


Release versions
---

 1. Make sure release notes in `NEWS` are up to date.

 2. Make a no-fast-forward merge from the last (non release candidate) release
    to the commit to be released:

    ```
    $ git checkout 1.3.0
    $ git checkout -b release-1.4.0
    $ git merge --no-ff main
    ```

    Copy the release notes for this version from `NEWS` into the merge commit
    message; reformat it from ASCIIdoc to Markdown and re-wrap line widths at
    the conventional 72 columns (see
    [this](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
    and [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)). See previous release
    commits for examples.

    ```
    $ git checkout main
    $ git merge --ff-only release-1.4.0
    $ git branch -d release-1.4.0
    ```

 3. Remove the "(unreleased)" tag from `NEWS`.

 4. Update the version in the dependency snippets in the README.

 5. Update the version in JavaDoc links in the READMEs.

 6. Update the Java version in the [`release-verify-signatures`
    workflow](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-verify-signatures.yml#L42).

    See the `openjdk version` line of output from `java -version`:

    ```
    $ java -version  # (example output below)
    openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.7+7)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.7+7, mixed mode)
    ```

    Given the above output as an example, update the workflow like so:

    ```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        java: ["17.0.7"]
    ```

    Check that this version is available in GitHub Actions.

 7. Amend these changes into the merge commit:

    ```
    $ git add NEWS README */README .github/workflows/release-verify-signatures.yml
    $ git commit --amend --reset-author
    ```

 8. Run the tests one more time:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew clean check
    ```

 9. Tag the merge commit with an `X.Y.Z` tag:

    ```
    $ git tag -a -s 1.4.0 -m "Release 1.4.0"
    ```

    No tag body needed since that's included in the commit.

10. Publish to Sonatype Nexus:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
    ```

11. Push to GitHub:

    ```
    $ git push origin main 1.4.0
    ```

12. Make GitHub release.

    - Use the new tag as the release tag.
    - Copy the release notes from `NEWS` into the GitHub release notes; reformat
      from ASCIIdoc to Markdown and remove line wraps. Include all changes since
      the previous release (not just changes since the previous pre-release).
    - Note the JDK version shown by `java -version` in step 6.
      For example: `openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18`.

13. Check that the ["Reproducible binary"
    workflow](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/actions/workflows/release-verify-signatures.yml)
    runs and succeeds.
